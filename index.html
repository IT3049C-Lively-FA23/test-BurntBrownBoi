      <h2>Background Info</h2>
      <section id="personalbackground">
        <p>Student of IT specializing in Game Development and Simulation. I recently completed my Responsive Web Design
          certification from FreeCodeCamp so I am now a certified front-end dev. Mostly... I despise TypeScript but I
          have to learn it. I am interning with the Cincinnati Insurance Companies and I am learning to make fully
          functioning Angular Applications and learned to test them using Swagger. Part-time simracer with a cheap
          chinese wheel setup that's basically a knockoff of the old MadCatz wheel. But I have yet to
          partake in a paid championship. That's basically it. Also, I still can't center a div after 2 years of
          learning, lol</p>

          <li>Does making it to my Junior year in one piece count as an achievement?</li>
          <li>Fixed a major front-end issue at my workplace, it was a missing semi-colon that the senior devs couldn't
            figure out. I'm serious, their entire UI was on the brink of collapse without a semi-colon for some
            unnecessary div until I popped into the teams meeting like the absolute Pro MLG programmer I am...</li>

      <h2>Favorite Games</h2>
      <section id="games">
        <p>Given how I like cars and racing is my favorite genre, I've been catching up with classics like Need for
          Speed Underground, Forza Horizon 3 and Motorsport 6. Recent games would be Assetto Corsa, the number of mods I
          have installed for this old simracer exceeds the original game file size of 20 gigs. My mods folder is worth
          75GB of tracks, cars, and graphical enhancements (no I didn't just make the road wet to make the game look
          good). I recently got God of War
          on Steam and I have to run it at the lowest settings to get a stable 60fps so that sucks. Other than that, I
          booted up my ancient Roblox account from 10 years ago and tried some shooter MoistCritikal talked about called
          FrontLines. That game has no right looking so good that I forgot I was playing Roblox. I've just been grinding
          on that recently because I hate CS:GO now more than I ever have before. Great game, toxic multiplayer. Also,
          BananaShooter..... Underrated FPS on Steam</p>
